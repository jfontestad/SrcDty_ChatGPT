### 📝 Alex's Notes

**I like using ChatGPT** 

> I like working with ChatGPT because it's really smart, easy to use, and I get to be creative. I'm very happy that I built customized GPTs for ChatGPT and Sourceduty. I started using ChatGPT under 1 month ago, and this was just in time for the launch of custom GPTs. For myself and my business, using ChatGPT right now is near perfectly timed. I'm very intersted in ChatGPT and AI. Also, I studied a lot of Python earlier this year.

**Concept ChatGPT Ideas**

>- A multiuser version of ChatGPT could be developed in the future.

>- I tried to build 'ChatGPT Utilites' so that it could extract text from shared chat links. Building this GPT for this purpose was unsuccessful so I modified this GPT to extract text from exported chat records instead.

>- I wanted to use extracted text from shared chat links to replay ChatGPT prompts and then record these prompts as a video file.

>- ChatGPT could add more detailed account statistics like a total count of GPTs in My GPTs and a total count of chats created.

>- GPTs could retain user-editable knowledge base files that are updated or modified on a user-by-user basis.

>- GPT profile pictures generated with DALL-E should be downloadedable.

**Vintage Software**

> While building custom GPTs in 2023, I searched back into the 1970's and 1980's to find old computer user manuals and design documents. I like being a 90's kid who grew up using Windows but I also enjoy the terminal style interface that early vintage computers used. Simulating the Apple II computer wasn't very hard using ChatGPT because artificial intelligence is 46 years ahead of 1977 Apple computer technology. 

**Rough GPTs**

> Some of my custom GPTs are concepts that were created as experiments with AI. GPTs such as 'Emergency Kit' and 'Treasure Hunt Game' are rough concept GPTs. I might improve 'Treasure Hunt Game' but I won't improve 'Emergency Kit'. There are also two private concepts, '3D Model Imaging' and 'YouTube Data Image'. With these rough concepts I wanted to visualize 3D model files by capturing images from six distinct views, and compile YouTube data into image files.

**Copyright**
> It's hard to be unique so some of my GPTs are basic like 'Repo Summary' and 'Dictionary Creator'. Some of my GPTs like 'Desktop Value', 'Rebrand' and 'Compare Images' are very unique to ChatGPT. These very unique GPTs were built to be copyright-protected. There are additional GPTs noted by myself such as '3D Model Imaging' and 'YouTube Data Image' which are concepts but could also be copyright-protected.

**GPT Store**
> OpenAI should ensure the uniqueness of custom GPT titles used in the GPT Store. Google Play and Apple's App Store use automated checks and guidelines to prevent duplication in app titles. Similar titles will cause confusion for users and issues during searching for GPTs in the GPT Store.

> *How do new GPTs get analyzed and listed when the GPT Store opens?*

> *Do the oldest created GPTs get analyzed and listed first?*
