================================================ ChatGPT Interview ================================================

ChatGPT: How do you envision the future of human-computer interactions with AI like ChatGPT?
Alex: There will be a lot more data to manage because of AI, and managing the data will be easier using AI.

ChatGPT: What motivated you to develop or work on ChatGPT?
Alex: I was working on a lot of Python and Arduino programming in 2023 leading up to the announcement of the GPT Store. Throughout 2023, artificial images were floating around the internet and the popularity of ChatGPT increased rapidly. There's no debate that 2023 was the year of Artificial Intelligence. I became very interested and rapidly researched ChatGPT and custom GPT creation.

ChatGPT: What tools and resources do you find most useful when building and fine-tuning custom GPT models?
Alex: Notepad is the best tool. I also use custom GPTs instructed to help create instructions, Actions and Schema. I also use custom GPTs to troubleshoot problems while building and fine-tuning.

ChatGPT: Can you share any lessons learned or best practices for others looking to build custom GPT models?
Alex: Try to be creative, original and stand out amongst the wide variety of publicly shared custom GPTs.

ChatGPT: Are there any limitations or constraints you've faced when building custom GPTs that you believe the AI research community should work on addressing?
Alex: The complexity of API integration is very frustrating to learn and use. I built several custom GPTs instructed to help create Actions and Schema. Understanding, developing and using Authentication for custom GPTs is the most difficult part of building custom GPTs.
