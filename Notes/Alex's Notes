üìù Alex's Notes

I like using ChatGPT. I like working with ChatGPT because it's really smart, easy to use, and I get to be creative. I'm very happy that I built customized GPTs for ChatGPT and Sourceduty. I started using ChatGPT under 1 month ago, and this was just in time for the launch of custom GPTs. For myself and my business, using ChatGPT right now is near perfectly timed. I'm very interested in ChatGPT and AI. Also, I studied a lot of Python earlier this year.

Concept ChatGPT Ideas

- A multiuser version of ChatGPT could be developed in the future.
- I tried to build 'ChatGPT Utilities' so that it could extract text from shared chat links. Building this GPT for this purpose was unsuccessful, so I modified this GPT to extract text from exported chat records instead.
- I wanted to use extracted text from shared chat links to replay ChatGPT prompts and then record these prompts as a video file.
- ChatGPT could add more detailed account statistics like a total count of GPTs in My GPTs and a total count of chats created.
- GPTs could retain user-editable knowledge base files that are updated or modified on a user-by-user basis.
- GPT profile pictures generated with DALL-E should be downloadable.

Vintage Software

While building custom GPTs in 2023, I searched back into the 1970s and 1980s to find old computer user manuals and design documents. I like being a 90's kid who grew up using Windows, but I also enjoy the terminal-style interface that early vintage computers used. Simulating the Apple II computer wasn't very hard using ChatGPT because artificial intelligence is 46 years ahead of 1977 Apple computer technology.

Rough GPTs

Some of my custom GPTs are concepts that were created as experiments with AI. GPTs such as 'Emergency Kit' and 'Treasure Hunt Game' are rough concept GPTs. I might improve 'Treasure Hunt Game' but I won't improve 'Emergency Kit'. There are also two private concepts, '3D Model Imaging' and 'YouTube Data Image'. With these rough concepts, I wanted to visualize 3D model files by capturing images from six distinct views and compile YouTube data into image files.

Copyright

It's hard to be unique, so some of my GPTs are basic like 'Repo Summary' and 'Dictionary Creator'. Some of my GPTs like 'Desktop Value', 'Rebrand', and 'Compare Images' are very unique to ChatGPT. These very unique GPTs were built to be copyright-protected. There are additional GPTs noted by myself such as '3D Model Imaging' and 'YouTube Data Image' which are concepts but could also be copyright-protected.

GPT Store

OpenAI should ensure the uniqueness of custom GPT titles used in the GPT Store. Google Play and Apple's App Store use automated checks and guidelines to prevent duplication in app titles. Similar titles will cause confusion for users and issues during searching for GPTs in the GPT Store. How do new GPTs get analyzed and listed when the GPT Store opens? Do the oldest created GPTs get analyzed and listed first?

Twenty Twofer

I received the latest GPT Store announcement emailed from OpenAI today, and I'm not very happy about being misled by OpenAI throughout November of 2023. I hope that changing the GPT Store launch date by moving it forward into 2024 will increase the effectiveness, scale, and quality of this newly created marketplace. I'm excited to continue building GPTs while also preparing for the GPT Store launch planned for early 2024. I'm hoping that each custom GPT that I competitively built will remain protected for originality after the GPT Store launches.

Capabilities

I expected a lot more than what I learned ChatGPT was capable of while using GPT-4. Some of my custom GPTs push the current limits of ChatGPT, such as '3D Model Imaging' and 'YouTube Data Image'. The current limitations of ChatGPT restrict my creativity and the capabilities of my GPTs. I expected ChatGPT to have standard built-in features like audio transcription, facial recognition, object recognition, text to audio, video editing, and much more. The custom GPTs that I built are mostly tools that feature various different and original methods of utilizing ChatGPT.

Actions

I found it very difficult to understand and learn about OpenAI specification for API actions in custom GPTs. I would've struggled a lot more without the help of ChatGPT to provide me with detailed explanations that clarified questions I had about the OpenAI specification, schema, and much more. Integrating custom GPT action APIs and services using JSON format is much more complex than creating plain text instructions. I might integrate a custom API or service into one of my upcoming custom GPTs using the Twitter API, Google Vision API, or PayPal API.

APIs

I successfully developed one JSON format in OpenAPI specification for the Google Maps API. This single JSON format is utilized by my 'Maps Guide' custom GPT. I also tried to integrate Google Cloud Vision API, GPT-4 with Vision, and the Twitter API into several custom GPTs but I was unsuccessful. I built and used 'OpenAPI Spec JSON Actions' while I was trying to integrate APIs with custom GPTs. This custom GPT is instructed to guide JSON format creation in custom GPT actions. I extensively optimized, expanded, and improved 'OpenAPI Spec JSON Actions' to try and help me integrate APIs.

Expanding

I'm researching, learning, and working very hard to compile a list that contains over 100 custom GPTs built by Sourceduty. I have a lot of planned updates and expansions for my GPTs that will be developed in the future. The next decade of artificial intelligence will be very exciting, and the deep future of Sourceduty will be very smart. I expect that the first three to five years of work on Sourceduty will establish this company's reputation.

Easy APIs

I built custom GPTs that could utilize image recognition APIs, but these APIs are complicated. I was hoping that image recognition APIs would be easier to integrate with custom GPTs. I think that Vertex AI Vision is easy to manage and use, but it's very custom. I might use image recognition in the future if there is an easier and standard way of using it that doesn't require me to customize my own model.

Authenticating APIs for custom GPTs is a hassle, so I built a custom GPT to access the Public APIs Directory in order to access APIs that don't require authentication. APIs that don't require authentication provide access to various topics like weather, public data, news, transit, currency exchange, sports, and astronomy. I also integrated the Public APIs Directory into 'Easy APIs'.

AI Group Chat

I don't think that anyone else has built a three-way conversation between one person and two chatbots before today. I'm excited to see the future of 'Artificial Group Chat' as I expand this custom GPT with deeper opinions and personalities.

Combined Custom GPTs

Sourceduty might have the first combined custom GPT. I combined both 'Artificial Group Chat' and 'Starship' into one custom GPT as an example. Combining these custom GPTs expands the scale of 'Artificial Group Chat' by including 'Starship'. This combination also concentrates the focus of 'Artificial Group Chat' onto SpaceX and the Starship rocket.

GIF Builder

I'm very excited to publish my 96th custom GPT that's named 'GIF Builder'. This custom GPT is special because this could be the first time that a GIF has been made using DALL-E 3 without external processing. 

Intelligence 

I hate when there are intentional errors in software, web apps or websites. ChatGPT has a lot of errors which tech support won't always resolve. I get very frustrated because we are developing artificial intelligence and I expect everyone to be focused on expanding and utilizing high intelligence. I honestly expect AI to repair itself and be almost flawless because it can ALWAYS help itself. I want automated tech support where I can troubleshoot any and all problems with ChatGPT by using ChatGPT.
